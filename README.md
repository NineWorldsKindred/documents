# Documents

We'll keep various documents in this repository, including (but not limited to) wireframes, design docs, content drafts, etc.

Organize things into folders based on type and location. ie - `content/public/`, `wireframes/private`, etc.

Use Markdown (`.md`) format for text files. This allows for detailed diffs and easy rendering on Github.
