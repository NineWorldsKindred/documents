# Private/Members Section Content (Outline)

* Dashboard(?)
  * We could probably integrate most of this stuff seamlessly into the site and may not need a dedicated "dashboard" in most cases.
* Calendar
  * Views
    * Expandable Agenda View
    * Calendar View
  * Features
    * RSVP Option
    * Moderated(?) Event Creation
    * Access level detection (only show event details to people with matching access level, so private events will just show as "private event")
      * Can also show location information based on access level, too. So no more of this "talk to kindred people for location details" stuff when it's other kindred members.
* Meeting Notes Archive
* Directory Of Members
  * Include skills they want to share with the community (brewing, sewing, woodworking, etc)
* Kindred By-Laws and Other Info For Being A Member
