Nine Worlds Kindred
===================

Nine Worlds Kindred is comprised of folks who hold true to the beliefs of a reconstructed religion, known as Asatru. In short, Asatru is based on the pre-christian beliefs and world view of our Nothern European ancestors. That said, we always aim to mention up front that we do not ascribe to the idea that Asatru is exclusive to one set of people, have no tollerance for those who wish to use Asatru as a platform for racism, and are an LGBTQ friendly kindred.

You can discover more about our views and what we do as a kindred by browsing around. Feel more than welcome to [reach out to us](contact.php) with any questions or comments you might have.
