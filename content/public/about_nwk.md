About Nine Worlds Kindred
=========================

Central Ohio Asatru is an active and mutually-supportive group of Asatru, mostly living in the greater Columbus area. Although COA was formally started in 2011, its founding members have known each other and have been heathen for many years. While no two of us practice Asatru the exact same way, we all honor the Aesir and Vanir, our ancestors, and the spirits of the land. We gather monthly so we can cooperate to resolve problems and discuss new projects to work on as a community. These projects are a major focus of the group, and allow us to express our creativity, learn new skills, build bonds within the folk, and support ourselves and others with the tangible products of our hands.

Past and present projects include:

   * Constructing, improving, and maintaining a building to use in ceremonies and gatherings
   * Crafting a sacred hammer to use in ceremonies, with the help of the OVHF (see below)
   * Studying the runes and discussing Scandinavian lore
   * Initiating workshops where members share knowledge of their crafting skills
   * Brewing mead and beer to share freely with the folk
   * Helping to organize events with the [Ohio Valley Heathen Fellowship](http://www.ohioheathens.org)
   * Hosting events such as pub moots, lore discussion groups and coffee meetups so that folk can share ideas and build community (visit the [events page](#) for more information)
