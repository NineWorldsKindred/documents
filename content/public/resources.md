##Online Resources
These online resources provide a lot of information, and they are completely free. It is true, Asatru is often seen as the religion with homework --- but that doesn't mean you have to spend a fortune amassing books to get started.

####[Temple of Our Heathen Gods](http://heathengods.com/)
Temple of our Heathen Gods is a superb source for material on Asatru.

####[The Northvegr Center](http://www.northvegr.org/)
The Northvegr Center provides a huge collection of free resources that are of interest to both heathens looking for basic materials as well as scholars. From their mission statement: "The New Northvegr Center (NNC) is a private educational foundation devoted to promoting greater awareness and understanding of the history, culture, values, and beliefs of pre-Christian northern Europe. NNC believes that studying the primary sources and gaining familiarity with sound, modern scholarship on these topics is essential to meaningful learning."

####[Sacred Texts](http://www.sacred-texts.com/neu/ice/index.htm)
Sacred Texts is another decent resource for free resources. They have an Icelandic specific section on their website where you can download the Eddas as well as som poems and sagas.

####[Jordsvin's Norse Heathen Pages](http://home.earthlink.net/~jordsvin/)
Jordsvin's Norse Heathen Pages is a place that many of us within COA look on fondly. It has maintained a presence on the web for a long time, and to this day is still a friendly place to visit for more information about heathenry.

##NWK Recommended Booklist
There are so many great works of research out there that are beneficial to reconstructing our religion. This is a list of some titles that members of Nine Worlds Kindred wanted to point out as especially good books to learn about Asatru from or to have on hand for reference purposes.
