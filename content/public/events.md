Heartland Heathmoot
-------------------

<heathmoot banner>

Heartland Heathmoot is a local gathering of heathens in the Ohio area that Nine Worlds Kindred is very proud to be involved with.

From one of the coordinators:

>The Heathen community is rapidly growing, and meeting other like-minded folk in person is the best way to build the bonds needed >to establish a strong and healthy community. Heathmoot is a gathering of individuals and kindreds from Ohio and the surrounding >region. [...] There, friends new and wold will meet to speak words of merit over the horn, share insights and entertainment, and >feast together. Planned activities include educational workshops and discussions, competitive games, community breakfast >Saturday and Sunday, and a grand feast on Saturday.
